      <section id='Bhavad'>
        <h1>Bhavad</h1>
        <h2>Misfortune Strikes</h2>
        <p>Javad's father Bhavad lived in Kampilyapur. Initially he was a rich businessman and was known as one of the reputed Shravak of Kampilyapur. Bhaavad was a daring merchant. He used to send ships loaded with goods to foreign countries and earn lot of wealth. Once this daring merchant sent his ships loaded with goods to foreign countries for sale, but owing to his bad luck all his ships got drowned in the ocean. He lost all his belongings and became very poor, but did not lose his faith in Jainism. He continued to practice as before.</p>
        <h2>Return of the fortune</h2>
        <p>Once a saint came to his place for "Gochri", the saint saw his bright future and told him that "Great man tomorrow if someone come to you to sell a mare, you buy it and nourish and nurture her appropriately. Your future is now going to rise". Bhaavad listened to saint's words and paid respect to the benevolent saint</p>
        <p>The following day a merchant came with mare. According to the saint's word Bhaavad purchased the mare on desired/requested price. He raised the mare providing her best of nourishment he could. She gave birth to a calf/foal. It had marvelous luster. After sometime, she gave birth to another fascinating calf/foal. Bhaavad properly nourished both the calves and made them athletic. The first foal was a real majestic horse. It was capable to been the pride of some king. The fame of this horse spread in all directions and many kings desired to purchase it but Bhaavad didn't sell it to anyone. At that time, King Tapan offered to purchase it hearing about its fame. King purchased the horse in 3 lac coins. Bhaavad's fortune was now at its best.</p>
        <h2>Madhumati(Mahua)</h2>
        <p>He gifted the second foal to great king Vikram. The generous king in return gave him the responsibility and ownership of Madhumati (Mahuva) and other twelve villages. Bhaavad now become more prosperous and richer. He made a splendid entry in Madhumati and took over the managing of 12 villages gifted to him. This is a sheer example of how intelligent the merchant (Vaniya) in earlier times were. Once a successful merchant who used to administer his business with pen, now started managing the political and social issues of the state with his intelligence. As soon as the great king handed over him the position of king, he took over the responsibility and started managing the 12 villages without even thinking about the difficulties he would face in doing so. He excelled in his duties and made his state proud.</p>
      </section>
      <section id='Javad'>
        <h1>Birth and Early Life of Javad</h1>
        <p>Soon he was blessed with a baby boy from his wife Bhavla and named him Javad. The Creator of Shatrunjay Raas describes how glorious his son would be:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src='/static/images/javadshah/1.png'/>
          <figcaption>Shatrunjay Raas</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Bhaavad raised his son giving him suitable education and when he reached adulthood he married to Sushila, daughter of a merchant of Ghati by Swayamvar.</p>
        <p>After few years elderly Bhaaved left for his heavenly abode and his brave son took over the mamagement of the state. Bhavad also administered his state with justice and morality as his father. He built stairwells, wells, lakes etc for recreation of the people and gathered lots of blessings from the public.</p>
        <h2>Foreign Invasion</h2>
        <p>Once the Mughal army suddenly attacked kampliyapur. Javad lost against the Mughal army and the emperor took him along with few peoples with himself to his capital. It seemed as if the Mughal emperor treated Javad with kindness, as he was allowed to perform all his religious activities with happiness.</p>
        <p>For this the poet writes:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src='/static/images/javadshah/2.png'/>
          <figcaption>Shatrunjay Raas</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Name of the Mughal emperor is not mentioned but the creator of Shatrunjay Raas describe him as</p>
        <figure>
          <img src='/static/images/javadshah/3.png'/>
          <figcaption>Shatrunjay Raas</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Editor's Note: The Mughal refers to tribe that orginated in Maha-chin, what is possibly today's Mongolia. They are also referred to as Yavan in other places. Yavan refers to Greek which also had a long history of invasion during that time. The Kushan Kings were contemporary of this time and also matches the description of being both Mughal and Yavan.</p>
        <h2>Prophecy</h2>
        <p>Jain Munis arrived to Javad's place while in "Vihar". (This proves that the great saints went to land outside present day India to preach the public and improve their next incarnation). The great saint educated him about the "Shatrunjay Mahamatay" and eluded to the prophecy that Javad would be the renovator of Shatrunjay Tirth. Javad was surprised to hear about himself as the renovator of the Shatrunjay tirth and asked the great saints if that Javad destined to do this great work is himself or some other person. The benevolent saint saw by their immense knowledge and told him that he is the one destined to perform this great task in the history of Jainism.</p>
        <h2>Return to Mahuva</h2>
        <p>Now Javad started fasting (Upvas) as advised by the jain muni. Sacrifice and austerity were the main weapon of our Aryavrat. Sacrifice and austerity have the strength as well as force to defeat or please anyone. Our ancient sages have moved the Indrasan of Indradev on basis of their powers gained by sacrifice and austerity, hence one month long fasting (Upvas) provided him too with special abilities. Henceforth, it is not surprising that he received the blessing of goddess and on request Chakeshwari Devi appeared and provided him help. With the blessing of Chakeshwari Devi, Javad was able to take the beautiful Idol of Lord Adinath to Madhumati(Mahuva) in Ship.</p>
        <p>Now his destiny began to shine and a ship that was lost previously reached Mahuva loaded with valuable goods. On one hand the ships arrived and another hand Balbrahmachari distinguished scholar Acharyadev Vajraswami maharaj came to Javad's state. Acharya Vajraswami was very intelligent and learned man. He had converted a famous Buddhist King of south into a disciple of Jainism with his preaching. His mother at a very early age of 3 years donated him to his saint father for the betterment of mankind and hence he left all the worldly pleasures in early age and became a saint. He took diksha in very early age and became a great acharya. Read more about Vajraswami here.</p>
        <p>Javad was rewarded with two great things at the same time. He thought about where to go first, to welcome the scholarly saint or find out about the valuable goods in the ships. In this respect the poet has expressed himself in very nice words so description in his words would be appropriate.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src='/static/images/javadshah/4.png'/>
          <figcaption>Shatrunjay Raas</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In this way Javad valued money insignificant in comparison of Acharya bhagvant and went to pay respect to Acharya first and then heads towards the ship to unload it.</p>
        <h2>The Great Endeavour Begins</h2>
        <p>Acharya Shri preached him about the path to liberation and inspired him to renovate Shratunjay tirth which was destined to be performed by him. After listening to the awakening preaching of Acharyadev, Javad took a sangh along with the Acharya maharaj and headed towards shrantunjay for its renovation.</p>
        <p>He cleanse the Shatrunjay mountain with milk and then he went on the holy mountain with the Idol of Lord Adinath. But the Adhisthayak dev, who had then become Mithyatva didn't allow establishment (sthapana) of the pratimaji. The Idol that was put by Javad during daytime was brought down by the evil dev residing there at night. The evil dev troubled Jhavad on several instances and hence he decided to discuss about it to gurudev Acharya Vajraswami.</p>
        <p>Vajraswami taught a lesson to the evil dev and established a new dev in his placae. For this too poet says:-</p>
        <figure>
          <img src='/static/images/javadshah/5.png'/>
          <figcaption>Shatrunjay Raas</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In this manner, after teaching a lesson to wicked dev and with the aid of the new established dev, Javad made a fabulous grand Derasar wherein he placed the Idol of Lord Adinath (Prathistha). Now after performing the Prathistha of the Lord, there came the auspicious day of hoisting the flag of the derasar. On that particular day, with great happiness and without thinking about the money and efforts involved Javad and his wife Sushila went on the crest of the temple to unfurl the flag. Here Javad was very happy and thought about how bright his fortune was that he was allotted this great work. The below are the feelings of his heart:</p>

        <p>As Javad showed his wholeheartedness in using his wealth for Shatrunjay Jinnordhhar, he was also compassionate towards poets, mendicant and poor and distributed lot of wealth to different tier of public. He showed compassion towards mankind and engraved his name in golden words in the history of Jainism.</p>
