        <h1>Altercation with Shardul Khan</h1>
        <p>The luxury of the Champaner city in the foothills of sacred Pavagadh mountain range in Gujarat is quite clear to the historians. Mahmud Begada was the ruler of Gujarat and his favourite Umrao Sardhul Khan was the subedar of Champaner. At the same time Champashi Mehta was the well known chief town merchant (Nagarseth). Once Champashi along with many members of the Mahajan community headed towards the king’s court (Raj Darbar). On the way they met subedar Sardhul Khan. who was also heading to the King’s court so he joined them. At that time an intelligent Brambhat came across their way. He stood up and as per his nature and profession, came forward to say few words in praise of Umrao. Then he came in front of Mahajan folded his hands and said many words in admiration for them. He said as follows addressing the Mahajan:</p>
        <quote class="shloka">
          બરદ કહે દકાલ દોહથ્થ, રાપે બંધ છોડણ સમરથ.<br/>
          રાયે થાપના ચારજરૂપ જીવોજીવદયા પ્રતિભૂપ.<br/>
          કરણિ કુમેર ખરદ બહુધાર વડહથ જગડું અવતરિ<br/>
          બભે કહી કીરત અત્ય ઘણી તવ તે શ્રવણે ખાંને સુણી<br/>         
        </quote>
        <p>He honoured them with many adjectives like God of Wealth (Kuber) and incarnation of famous jain philanthropist Jagdushah.</p>
        <p>Shardul Khan was jealous. He went to the emperor and lied to the king, “Your highness, this rhymester eats at your mercy but he is praising the merchant community more than you.” Without even verifying the authenticity of this statement, he ordered that the Bhat be brought before him. Shardul Khan was pleased with himself. Champashi was worried and thought: "What happened was bad- but what happened was destined to happen”.</p>
        <p>After some time Bhat was presented before the emperor. The emperor asked him: You live at my mercy and sing songs in praise of others in my state. The truthful and brave Bhat answered without any fear that “Your highness, we praise the Mahajan correctly. We only sing of the great deeds their ancestors have done in the past. God of Wealth (Kuber) and saviours from drought are the titles they have inherited from their forefathers like the well known philanthropist Jagdusha. In Vikram Samvant 1315 there was a drought which is still famous as “panrotra” (Badluck). During that time Jagdusha of Bhadreshwar was the one who saved millions of lives across entire community without looking at their caste/ creed or status. He was a saviour for all rich, poor, small, big etc. It is said that Drought as the one in 1315 has not occurred in ages and another benefactor like Jagdusha has not born yet".</p>
        <p>Hearing this emperor got very angry. However, he controlled his anger, dismissed the general assembly and headed towards his palace. On the other hand city chief merchant (Nagarseth) advised Bhat that he should not argue with the big heads. In such arguments, both winning and losing are disadvantageous.</p>
        <quote class="shloka">
          કહે શેઠ કીજે નહીં વડા સરીખું વાદ<br/>
          હારે જીતે રાણુ હુઇ વાત વધે વિખવાદ<br/>
        </quote>
        <p>In reply bhat said:</p>
        <quote class="shloka">
          શેઠ પ્રતે શું કવ્ય કહે એવો અમ આચાર,<br/>
          બોલું ખોલ ન પાલટડું જે કેપ્યો કીરતાર;<br/>         
        </quote>
        <p>i.e. If God too gets angry by my words than too I am not going to reverse the verse said in praise of Sheth.</p>
        <quote class="shloka">
          કાયર્‌ ખડગ ને કૃપણુ વચન કાચબકોટ નિધાન<br/>
          સાની દાન ભટવચન્ન એ ગજદંત સમાન<br/>
        </quote>
        <p>i.e. The words of Bhat are strong as teeth of elephant. The Seth were silent. The Bhat added further:</p>
        <quote class="shloka">
          લેલા રસોઇજીને કવ્યજી  આ મોંલે નહોઇ મુલ,<br/>
          દાતા જ્યમ રેતે! થકો ન ગણે પાત્ર કુપાત્ર;<br/>
          ખોલ્યું ભાટ ન સસહે મરણુ તૃયણા માત્ર.<br/>
        </quote>
        <p>Hearing this, Seth asked the Bhat not to worry. When the king would ask, they would provide.</p>

        <h1>The Terrible Famine and The Challenge</h1>
        <p>After some years, there came a bad year and there were no rains and hence the public was quite troubled by shortage of food and water. People started losing hope and their tolerance was at its limit. Emperor saw people’s sorrow, heard the plea for mercy by the poor. As he got the updates on draught from the treasurer of the kingdom, he remembered Brambhat and called him to the palace. He told Brambhat that, "You were singing in praise for the greatness of jain philanthropist now you have a chance to set an example for the same in these hard times". He told that if Jain Shravak give food to everyone then they correctly succeed in retaining the title of Shah given to them, otherwise both who praised them as well as who ask for praise are culprits.</p>
        <p>Bhat left the palace and went directly to the city chief (Nagar seth) and gathered the whole community of the Mahajan and started praising them. After praising the mahajan community, Bhat told them that the emperor has challenged the Mahajan community to save everyone from the famine. Emperor is asking Mahajan to provide food to all needy and prove their sincerity towards mankind or relinquish the title of Shah conferred on to them. After discussing with the Mahajan, Bhat went to the emperor to seek one month time and informed him that mahajan have accepted the challenge.</p>
        <p>Emperor agreed with the proposal. The whole mahajan community gathered to discuss plan of action. In it were present, Champashi Mehta, and his brothers; Karamsi, Kalyan, Kamalsi, Vemalsi, Thersi, Pratap, Padamsi... Manekchand, Lalji, Laxmichand etc. the entire community gathered. Champashi Mehta pledged to be beneficiary for one day. Other four people together agreed for one day each. All took the pledge as per their capacity and that summed up to 4 months.</p>
        <p>Now for expenditure for rest of the months, they planned to visit Patan for help. Patan was then the famous and prosperous state with many benevolent shravaks. The city chief himself along with prosperous dignitaries headed towards Patan. When they reached Patan, the prosperous shravaks of Patan welcomed the mahajan of Champaner with great courtesy. Jain Shravaks from Patan showed readiness to take the expenses for two months.</p>
        <p>Next the mahajan headed towards Vearat where they got charity pledge for another 10 days. Twenty days had already passed between Patan and Vearat and now only 10 days were remaining of the one month stipulation. In those 10 days they had to make arrangement for the remaining year. Time was running out and their prestige was at stake. And also if they don’t reached on time, Bhat too would commit suicide. This was real time for test of mahajan. Yet the mahajan left for Dholka from Vearat (Dhandhuka).</p>

      <section id='Pledge'>
        <h1>Kheema's Great Pledge</h1>
        <p>On their way, they came to the town of Hadala. Resident of Hadala, Kheema Derani, came to know about the arrival of the Mahajan of Champaner in the outskirts of his town. Kheema was a simple man. Wearing his dirty old clothes went to meet the mahajan and requested them to accept his plea. Looking at the shravak with old dirty clothes talking politely, they thought that he would demand for money. Champashi asked Kheema to ask for anything he wants without any fear. Here Kheema requested them to have Lunch at his place before leaving. The Mahajans thought it would not be proper to ignore his request and hence they accepted his request and went to Kheema’s house for Lunch. Kheema treated all of them with great hospitality.</p>
        <p>After honouring the Mahajans with great hospitality and doing proper Sadharmik Bhakti, Kheema with great politeness asked the reason for mahajan’s­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ expedition. Here Champashi wrote Khemma’s name in the list of donors and gave it to him and told the whole story. Khemma was very pleased to see his name in the list of donors and was obliged to learn that they considered him worthy of this respect. He said he’ll ask his father and let them know how he could contribute to this great deed. When Kheema went to ask his father, a man with King size heart, he said that “Son! This type of opportunity will not come again in your lifetime”. This is like God himself coming to your place. You should not miss this opportunity and give as much as you can". He further said that “Kheema, my son, one who recongnizes time is a generous human being, hence honour this 25th Thirthankar “Sangh” as much as you can". Kheema was very happy with his father’s advice. One who have so generous parent is obvious would have generosity in his blood and would not hesitate to donate. That was it for Kheema… Permission for donation granted. Having granted the permission by his father, Kheema went to the Mahajan with great procession.</p>
        <p>He told the Mahajans, "I am very happy that you considered me suitable for serving the mankind. Although I am not worthy enough to show my gratitude to the sangh for the belief they have shown in me, but I request you to please accept my 360 days". Mahajans were stunned by his pledge. A person with old dirty torn clothes was so generous. Some people were really surprised by his sadharmik bhakti while others thought that he is over-committing and might not have the money to give later? Now Champashi couldn’t stop himself and said: "Kheema it is not advisable to commit anything beyond your limits, as if you are unable to fulfill promised thing our reputation is at stake. Hence please rethink before committing for anything". Kheema answered: "I have thought for quite a long time and have committed too less compared to what I have been given". Champashi believed Kheema looking at his confidence, he must be having wealth or else he wouldn’t dare to commit so much. Now the Shravaks from Champaner requested Kheema to take a shower and change his clothes so that they could go to Champaner and inform the emperor. To this Kheema replied: “No matter where we go, what our status is, we don’t change our clothes or our pattern of living for exhibiting it to others”.</p>

        <h1>Emperor confers the title of Shah</h1>
        <p>	Champashi was amazed at his generosity and modesty. Then the mahajan of Champaner brought Kheema to Champaner in a Phalkhi (Palanquin). Mahajan took him to the emperor and told that this Shravak from Hadala alone will give food to all needy for 360 days. Emperor too was surprised with his appearance and asked in astonishment that how many villages you own. To this Kheema replied two villages, the emperor enquired which two? In answer Kheema said Pali (Smallest of the currency coin at that time) and Paali (Biggest of vessel that can accommodate large amount of food). He kept one lowest denominator coin and a large vessel in front of the emperor and said that I give a little and get back large amounts in return(This meant that whatever charity I am doing is nothing is comparison to the blessings and prayers I will get in return from the people).</p>
        <p>Emperor was pleased with his reply and was glad that such great generous people resided in his kingdom. After this emperor with happy heart bestowed honorific title to the Mahajan and from then onwards the proverb became popular among everyone: "There is one Shah - the Vaniyas or the Merchant and another Shah the Ruler or the Emperor".</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>	Really blessed is Kheema’s generosity, politeness, simplicity which impressed the emperor. He didn’t abandon his simplicity and humility even in front of the king. He used up a lot of money in drought and saved Gujarat retaining the title of ‘Shah’ to the Mahajans. At present he is not alive but still his generosity, brightens the pages of history as is the brightness of sun. We can’t give more than thanks to this generous man with large heart. After that year of drought he visited sacred pilgrim of Shree Shratunjay and left for his heavenly abode. We bow to this great Shravak millions of times. Also with a wish that someone from this great country India do as great a thing as Kheema.</p>
