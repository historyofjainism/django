                Nine Gandhars attained salvation before Lord Mahavir Swami. Lord's Nirvana was followed by Gautamswamiji's Nirvana. For this reason, his disciple tradition came under the guidance of Fifth Gandhar Sudharma Swamiji. For this reason the current Shramana tradition belongs to Sudharmaswamiji

                Muslim aggressors broke the main idol on Shatrunjaya. Karma Shah of Udaipur built a new idol at an auspicious time, which was consecrated by Shri Vidyamandanasuri. At the time of pratistha, God breathed seven times. This idol is the mulnayak on the peak of Shatrunjaya today.
